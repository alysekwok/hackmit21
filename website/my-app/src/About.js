            <p>Hello and welcome to <b>book exchange</b>, an online platform that connects
            communities through educational resources. At book exchange, students, parents, and educators
            can communicate and exchange textbooks, test prep workbooks, and other academic
            materials safely. With book exchange, those who might not have the financial means to buy these
            resources first hand can reach out to a community member that may be looking to declutter their own.  </p>
